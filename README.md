# Pepasur üê∏

**An on-chain Mafia game powered by Aptos Blockchain**\

Pepasur is a multiplayer Mafia-style social deduction game built
entirely on the Aptos blockchain. Players take on mythological roles,
**ASUR (Mafia)**, **DEV (Doctor)**, **MANAV (Villager)**, and **RISHI
(Detective)** --- and compete through staking, commit-reveal mechanics,
and strategic gameplay.

Each game requires players to stake APT tokens, creating real economic
incentives for fair play. Winners receive rewards distributed
automatically through smart contracts, while losers get partial refunds.
The game features pixel-art styling, real-time multiplayer gameplay, and
transparent on-chain mechanics.
