# Pepasur ENS - Minimal Integration (Experimental)

This is a separate, experimental project to explore the integration of ENS (Ethereum Name Service) with the Pepasur game. It is not directly related to the main game and is not required for the game to function.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how ENS can be used to:

-   Assign human-readable names to player addresses.
-   Store game-related metadata in ENS text records.
-   Create subdomains for game contracts.

## Status

This project is experimental and is not actively maintained.
